## Knapsack Optimization Algorithm: Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through a simple example to illustrate how the knapsack optimization algorithm works for course selection.

## Input Data

- Total available time: 10 hours
- Learning Objects (LOs): 
  1. LO1: 3 hours (prerequisite for LO3)
  2. LO2: 4 hours
  3. LO3: 5 hours (leaf node)
  4. LO4: 2 hours (leaf node)
- Known topics: None
- Topological order: [LO1, LO2, LO4, LO3]

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Initialize DP Table

Create a DP table with rows representing LOs and columns representing time:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
LO1 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
LO2 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
LO4 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
LO3 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```

### 2. Fill DP Table

#### For LO1 (3 hours, value 1):
- Can be included when time >= 3
- Fill row LO1:
```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
LO1 0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
```

#### For LO2 (4 hours, value 1):
- Can be included when time >= 4
- Compare with previous best (LO1)
- Fill row LO2:
```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
LO2 0  0  0  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2
```

#### For LO4 (2 hours, value 5 as leaf node):
- Can be included when time >= 2
- Compare with previous best (LO1 + LO2)
- Fill row LO4:
```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
LO4 0  0  5  5  5  6  6  7  7  7  7
```

#### For LO3 (5 hours, value 5 as leaf node):
- Can be included when time >= 5 and LO1 is included (prerequisite)
- Compare with previous best (LO1 + LO2 + LO4)
- Fill row LO3:
```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
LO3 0  0  5  5  5  6  6  7  7  7  7
```

### 3. Backtrack to Find Selected Courses

Start from the bottom-right cell (value 7) and work backwards:
1. LO3 not selected (7 comes from previous row)
2. LO4 selected (value increased from 2 to 7), remaining time: 8
3. LO2 selected (value increased from 1 to 2), remaining time: 4
4. LO1 selected (value increased from 0 to 1), remaining time: 1

### 4. Final Selection

Selected Learning Objects: [LO1, LO2, LO4]
Total value: 7
Total time used: 9 hours

## Conclusion

The algorithm optimally selected LO1, LO2, and LO4, maximizing the value within the 10-hour time constraint. It prioritized the leaf node LO4 (value 5) and included LO1 and LO2 to maximize the remaining time usage.
